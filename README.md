# Spencer's Portfolio Website

## Overview

While learning django to create my study web app Daedalus Library, I decided to make this website to get familure with django and how to build a website using it. I also thought that it would be good to have this as a resume platform.

This repository holds:
* The Project Folder - "SjdPortfolio"
* "Home" app
    * Controls content for the various projects on the site
* "Static" Folder -
    * Holds photo and potentially any other static parts of the website.
* Templates -
    * Holds the HTML files for the website.
