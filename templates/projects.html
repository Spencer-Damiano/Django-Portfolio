          <h3>What is Daedalus Library?</h3>
          <p>
            Daedalus Library was born out of a frustration with different study tips that I would come across. Most of them would work however to get everything in an
            ideal setting was always a hastle. I decdied that I should combine all of the tools, tips, and tricks that I feel work well and put them into one space.

          </p>
          <h3>
            Why the name Daedalus Library?
          </h3>
          <p>
            there is a lot in a name. Daedalus was a Greek inventor who was known as the best inventor in all of Greece and made many inventions that . He also had made a lot of terrible decisions.
            He killed his nephew because he saw that he might take the title of greatest inventor from him. He helped create the Minautor and the Labyrinth to keep it
            hidden. He betrayed the king which cause his son Icarus to be imprisoned in the same Labyrinth which he build. When escaping his Son died because he flew too close to the sun.
            What fascinated me about this story is father and son both had flown to close to the sun. Icarus literally and Daedalus figuratively.
            <br>
            <br>
            I thought about what Daedalus would do after being exiled twice, losing his son, and having to face his mistakes. I think he would've made a library, first as a place to still
            tinker and display his inventions. Eventually it would become a place where he would share his knowledge and experience with others. I think that is what Daedalus Library is. The
            world has become an increasingly complex place and we need a space where we can learn from mistakes, but also invent, create, and share.
